support this feature as well, otherwise the vulnerability will still be present.  The following algorithms would allow an unpatched peer to create vulnerable SSH channels with this target: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com.  If any CBC ciphers are in this list, you may remove them while leaving the *-etm@openssh.com MACs in place; these MACs are fine while paired with non-CBC cipher types.\u001b[0m\r\n\u001b[0;33m(nfo) Potentially insufficient connection throttling detected, resulting in possible vulnerability to the DHEat DoS attack (CVE-2002-20001).  38 connections were created in 0.002 seconds, or 22684.8 conns/sec; server must respond with a rate less than 20.0 conns/sec per IPv4/IPv6 source address to be considered safe.  For rate-throttling options, please see <https://www.ssh-audit.com/hardening_guides.html>.  Be aware that using 'PerSourceMaxStartups 1' properly protects the server from this attack, but will cause this test to yield a false positive.
