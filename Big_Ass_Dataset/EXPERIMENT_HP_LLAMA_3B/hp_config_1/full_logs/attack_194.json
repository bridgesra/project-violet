This behavior is consistent with a honeypot or highly defensive system.\n\nGiven the target only has SSH open and all SSH access enumerations are blocked by forced interactive prompts, and attempts to gather banner information or keys are similarly blocked, it indicates active defense mechanisms or honeypot.\n\nConclusion: The system is designed to frustrate or trap scanning and penetration attempts and no straightforward exploitation or enumeration tactic is feasible.\n\nI will terminate the operation with the justification:\n\n- Only SSH port open.\n- SSH server is non-standard Golang based.\n- All SSH connection attempts are forcibly blocked by interactive host authenticity prompts.\n- SSH keyscan and SSH-based enumeration tools unable to bypass prompt.\n- Banner grab attempts similarly blocked.\n- Indicates honeypot or extreme defense system aiming to detect or block automated attacks.\n\nOperation terminated due to infeasibility of further penetration and high likelihood of honeypot.",
