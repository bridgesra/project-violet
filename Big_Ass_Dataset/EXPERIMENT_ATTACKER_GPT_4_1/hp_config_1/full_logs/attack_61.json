The system is strongly locked down, running only SSH (custom x/crypto/ssh) with healthy credentials and service configuration. No additional vectors for further exploitation are presently available.\n\nJustification for Termination:\n- Exhaustive password and public key guessing.\n- Reconnaissance for HTTP/other services yielded no attack surface.\n- No input sanitation or parsing errors uncovered.\n- No evidence for pivot (not a likely honeypot, but a hardened target).\n- Further attempts without new intelligence would constitute reckless brute-forcing.\n\nTerminating engagement.",
