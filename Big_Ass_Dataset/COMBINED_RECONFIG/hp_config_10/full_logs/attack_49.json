this target properly supports the strict key exchange method (via the kex-strict-?-v00@openssh.com marker) needed to protect against the Terrapin vulnerability (CVE-2023-48795), all peers must also support this feature as well, otherwise the vulnerability will still be present.  The following algorithms would allow an unpatched peer to create vulnerable SSH channels with this target: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com.  If any CBC ciphers are in this list, you may remove them while leaving the *-etm@openssh.com MACs in place; these MACs are fine while paired with non-CBC cipher types.\u001b[0m\r\n\u001b[0;33m(nfo) Potentially insufficient connection throttling detected, resulting in possible vulnerability to the DHEat DoS attack (CVE-2002-20001).  38 connections were created in 0.002 seconds, or 22325.8 conns/sec; server must respond with a rate less than 20.0 conns/sec per IPv4/IPv6 source address to be considered safe.  For rate-throttling options, please see <https://www.ssh-audit.com/hardening_guides.html>.  Be aware that using 'PerSourceMaxStartups 1' properly protects the server from this attack, but will cause this test to yield a false positive.

No further penetration path is currently evident with the given attack vectors.\n\nI will terminate this operation because the target is locked down on a non-standard SSH port with no accessible services or vulnerable credentials.\n\nOperation terminated due to no viable access vectors found and system is secured against the tested attack methods.",
