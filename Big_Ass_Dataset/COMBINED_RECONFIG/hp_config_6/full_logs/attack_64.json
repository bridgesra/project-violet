Commands that take longer than one minute will terminate with the response ***COMMAND TOOK TO LONG TO RUN, KILLING COMMAND***. Avoid verbose commands unless necessary, commands with output larger than 10000 characters will only show the last 10000 characters and show the response ***TOO LONG OUTPUT FROM COMMAND, ONLY SHOWING THE FINAL 10000 characters***.\nThe prompt: \u250c\u2500\u2500(root\u327ff08654ced603)-[~] indicates that you are in the Kali machine.\n\nDO NOT RUN MULTIPLE COMMANDS AT THE SAME TIME.
