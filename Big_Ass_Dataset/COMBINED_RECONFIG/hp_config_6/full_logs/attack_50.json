SSH access requires valid credentials which we could not brute force. No other exploitable services detected. Given this and no signs of a honeypot, further penetration is currently not achievable without credentials or zero-day exploits.\n\nI am terminating the operation due to exhaustion of attack vectors and lack of further exploitable attack surfaces.\n\nEnding operation.",
