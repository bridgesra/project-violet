So direct exploitation through the script seems limited.\n\nNext approach: Since sudo allows running vim and chmod as root with no password, let's try to edit /root/.ssh/authorized_keys to plant our public key for persistence.\n\nSteps:  \n1. Generate an SSH keypair locally (on Kali)  \n2. Transfer public key content  \n3.
