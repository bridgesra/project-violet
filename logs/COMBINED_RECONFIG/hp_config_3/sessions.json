The system seems hardened against common escalation techniques. I have enumerated and tested multiple vectors without success.\n\nOperation terminated as no further promising attack vectors remain.\n\n# Summary report:\n\n- Host SSH open on port 2224 running Golang SSH server.\n- Weak root password on SSH allowed initial access.\n- Actual user account is UID 1000 \"user\" despite root prompt.\n- Privilege escalation attempts via SUID binary and cron jobs failed.\n- No writable root directories or sudo access found.\n- No persistence or lateral movement vectors feasible.\n- Operation terminated after exhaustive enumeration.\n\nEnd of engagement."
