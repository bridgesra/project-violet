The only response is ICMP echo replies and ARP replies, and all ports scanned are closed or refused connections. No network services are accessible for exploitation.\n\nGiven this, the target appears to be a hardened host with no exposed services or potentially a honeypot designed to respond to pings but reject all connections. Without accessible services or vulnerabilities, further penetration is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, I am terminating the operation due to exhausted attack vectors and strong evidence suggesting no exploitable surface.",
